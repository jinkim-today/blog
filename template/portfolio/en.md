# AI Chatbot System

An advanced customer service chatbot that uses natural language processing to provide intelligent responses and automate customer support.

## Overview

This project involved developing a comprehensive chatbot system that can understand customer queries, provide relevant responses, and escalate complex issues to human agents when necessary.

## Key Features

- **Natural Language Understanding**: Advanced NLP models to comprehend user intent
- **Contextual Conversations**: Maintains conversation context across multiple exchanges
- **Multi-language Support**: Handles English and Korean conversations
- **Integration Ready**: APIs for integration with existing customer service platforms
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Real-time insights into bot performance and customer satisfaction

## Technical Implementation

### Machine Learning Pipeline
- **Data Collection**: Gathered and processed customer service conversations
- **Model Training**: Fine-tuned transformer models for intent classification
- **Response Generation**: Implemented retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
- **Continuous Learning**: System improves from new conversations
