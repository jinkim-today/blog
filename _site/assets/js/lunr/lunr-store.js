Cookie-Cutter Photo-Booths   Most rental booths are plastic, visually clash with wood-accented Canadian venues, and still cost a premium.   My Solution  Self-Portrait Photography   A fully equipped, walk-in studio—no photographer required. Sessions start at CA$75, generating 300 + shoots in year 1.   Wooden Photo-booth   A wood-clad booth we engineered and built completely in-house—unlike competitors who buy expensive off-the-shelf units. This removes vendor mark-ups, maintenance contracts, and tool-rental fees, letting us match rustic wedding aesthetics and offer prices 30–40 % lower than typical photo-booth rentals.

        "excerpt":"Snapshot  HappyHourMap is a location-based web application that connects users with nearby happy hour specials. The platform offers real-time filtering by time, distance, cuisine category, and deal type, helping users discover relevant promotions while driving traffic to local establishments.                                                                                          HappyHourMap Web Application       Market Problem  Fragmented Discovery Experience   Despite their popularity, happy hour specials remain difficult for consumers to discover without visiting multiple websites or social media accounts.   Limited Promotional Channels for Restaurants   Small and independent restaurants lack effective digital platforms to showcase their happy hour specials and increase visibility. Existing review sites rarely highlight these promotions despite their ability to drive significant foot traffic during off-peak hours.   Key Contrinution   Tech Stack     Frontend: React, TypeScript   Backend: Node.js   Data Scraping with AI: Python, Ollama, LangChain,BeautifulSoup, Pandas   Built Responsive Full Stack Web Application   Designed and developed a responsive web application using React, TypeScript, and Node.js backend. Implemented geolocation services with the Google Maps API for proximity-based results and real-time filtering capabilities. Live Site                                                                                          HappyHourMap Mobile &amp; Desktop View       Intelligent Data Collection System   Developed a sophisticated data pipeline that combines web scraping with AI-powered data extraction. Using Python, BeautifulSoup, and LangChain with local LLMs (Ollama), the system autonomously harvests happy hour information from diverse web sources, processes unstructured data, and standardizes it for database storage—reducing manual data entry by over 85%.   SEO &amp; Performance Optimization   Implemented hybrid rendering architecture combining server-side rendering (SSR) for initial page loads and client-side rendering (CSR) for subsequent interactions. This approach improved SEO metrics by 45% while maintaining sub-2 second load times and high Lighthouse performance scores.   Resources      HappyHourMap Website  ","categories": [],
