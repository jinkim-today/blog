## Market Problem
### Overpriced, Overbooked Shoots  

Traditional photographers charge premium rates and fill their calendars weeks in advance—overkill for customers who just need high-quality, affordable images.  


### Cookie-Cutter Photo-Booths  

Most rental booths are plastic, visually clash with wood-accented Canadian venues, and still cost a premium.


## My Solution 
### Self-Portrait Photography

A fully equipped, walk-in studio—no photographer required. Sessions start at **CA$75**, generating **300 + shoots in year 1**.  

### Wooden Photo-booth

A wood-clad booth we engineered and built **completely in-house**—unlike competitors who buy expensive off-the-shelf units. This removes vendor mark-ups, maintenance contracts, and tool-rental fees, letting us match rustic wedding aesthetics and offer prices **30–40 % lower** than typical photo-booth rentals.

## Key Contrinution

### Built Company Website 

Built company website using `React` with `TypeScript` and `Square checkout`. [Link](https://photobyme.ca)
