## Container Queries

Container queries revolutionize responsive design by allowing components to respond to their container's size rather than the viewport:

```css
.card-container {
  container-type: inline-size;
}

@container (min-width: 400px) {
  .card {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr;
  }
}
```

## Cascade Layers

Organize your CSS with explicit layering:

```css
@layer reset, base, components, utilities;

@layer components {
  .button {
    padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
    border-radius: 0.25rem;
  }
}
```

## New Color Functions

Enhanced color manipulation with `color-mix()` and relative colors:

```css
.theme-button {
  background: color-mix(in srgb, blue 70%, white);
  border: 1px solid oklch(from blue calc(l - 0.2) c h);
}
```

## Conclusion

These modern CSS techniques provide developers with unprecedented control over styling and responsiveness, making it easier to create sophisticated, maintainable designs.
